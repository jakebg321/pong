# Build Command (to be used in Render's Build Command field):
cd pong && npm install && npm run build

# Start Command (to be used in Render's Start Command field):
cd pong && npm start

# Note: The cd pong is necessary because Render clones your repository into a directory,
# and we need to ensure we're in the correct directory before running the commands.
# npm start will run the production server (server.cjs) which also serves the built static files.
